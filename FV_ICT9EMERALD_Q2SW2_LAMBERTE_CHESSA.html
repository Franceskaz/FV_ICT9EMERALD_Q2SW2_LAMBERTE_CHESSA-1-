The points are available in a wide range of colors, such as seal, blue, lilac, chocolate, and red. They can be be solid or have a light tortoiseshell or tabby patterning. All Birman cats, regardless of color, should have four white paws and blue eyes. The origins of the Birman cat breed are unknown, however it's possible that they came from Burma, where they may have been revered. The Birman of today is valued as a kind and kind friend.</h5></td>
